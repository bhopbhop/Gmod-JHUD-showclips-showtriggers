# Gmod-JHUD
JHUD, showclips, and showtriggers for the new pg gamemode on garrys mod. Untested on any other gamemode but works fine with the gamemode found here. https://czarchasm.club/bhop.html

Jhud does not work properly, if somebody wants to fix it they can. Any jump that shows your speed in number (i.e 1st - 6th, 12th, 18th, 24th etc) will always be blue as long as your speed is above 276 as for some reason those jumps calculate gain off of max prestrafe.



These were all developed by gaztoof.


All you have to do is drag the jhud folder into garrysmod/addons
